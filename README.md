logs_analyzer
=============

My first PyQt4 app. It can load from local file or download from logs.ovh.net logs (apache access or error log, ftp log, ssh log) and for access log generate report about security problems and awstats from that log file. To generate security problems report it use apache-scalp script wroted by neuroo. It is my first such project so all feedback is welcome :)
